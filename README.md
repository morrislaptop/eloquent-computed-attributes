# EloquentComputeOnSave

> Automatically compute attributes on Laravel Eloquent models when their input changes

*Computed attributes* provide an alternative to Laravel's built-in *accessors*. In contrast to accessors, *computed attributes* are not computed when their value is requested, but rather when their dependencies change (*computed attributes* are persisted in the DB). This works by listening for a models' `saving` event and checking whether the dependencies of a *computed attribute* are dirty. If so, the attribute is recomputed and its new value is updated in the database. Dependencies of a computed attribute are declared through the signature of the "compute" method. Argument names in that method correspond to attributes on the model.

## Getting Started

### 1. Installation
```
composer require sehrgut/eloquent-compute-on-save
```

### 2. Define a *computed attribute*

Let's say we have a `Post` model with a `text` column and a `text_excerpt` column. Every time the value of `text` changes, we want to recompute the `text_excerpt` column. This is what our `Post` class could look like:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use SehrGut\EloquentComputeOnSave\ComputesOnSave;

class Post extends Model
{
    use ComputesOnSave;

    /** @inheritDoc */
    protected $fillable = ['title', 'text'];

    /**
     * Recompute the `text_excerpt` attribute when `text` changes.
     *
     * @param  string $text
     * @return string
     */
    public function computeTextExcerptAttribute(string $text): string
    {
        return substr($text, 0, 255) . 'â€¦';
    }
}
```

What's happening under the hood:

1. The `ComputesOnSave` trait recognises that by defining `computeTextExcerptAttribute`, we want to compute a `text_excerpt` attribute (following the naming convention of [Accessors & Mutators](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/eloquent-mutators#accessors-and-mutators))
2. The trait derives the computed attributes' dependencies from the method signature: If `$this->text` changes (`$text` being part of the method signature), `text_excerpt` needs to be recomputed
3. On each `saving` event of the model, if any of the computed attributes' dependencies (arguments of the method) have changed, the method will be called with the updated values as arguments, and its return value will be assigned to `$this->text_excerpt` before the models' `save()` method is called.
